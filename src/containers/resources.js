+ "a percent. If you look up what the city is famous for, it’s hard to find an answer. So when brothers Matt "
+ "and Brad Shultz of Cage The Elephant started writing their newest record, Tell Me I’m Pretty via RCA Records" 
+ "they went back to their hometown to spark some memories where everyone knows everyone– especially their band."

+ "<br>'At some point you have to get the fuck out,' guitarist Brad Shultz said. 'There wasn’t anything to"  
+ "do in Bowling Green; a lot of kids get into bands. As far as the younger generation and even generations"

+ "were young. After the divorce, their mother dated Matt's football coach leading him to quit the team "
+ "and play music in a state of rebellion;" 

+ "Matt married his fiancé Juliette Buchs, French actress and model, at the beginning of 2014 in a civil ceremony"

        bio: "'COME A LITTLE CLOSER,' THE FIRST SINGLE FROM Cage The Elephant’s third album, Melophobia," 
+ "is steered by the powerful bass of Daniel Tichenor. His thick, muted picking on the song conveys all of the"                 
+ "grittiness that is found on the rest of the album, where Tichenor stands out with a variety of funky, galloping,"
+ "and driving bass riffs that hone the melody as a way to move the song. It’s a surprising fact that Tichenor had"  
+ "never touched a bass before joining this band, and it’s even more surprising to find that a near death experience"
+ "is what led him to join."
+ "After moving to Louisville, Kentucky at age 23, Tichenor had set out to make a name for himself as a guitarist,"  
+ "when suddenly life took a vicious turn: A car crashed into him at 45 miles per hour while he was in a crosswalk"  
+ "to get home. With two shattered legs and a long road to recovery, Tichenor returned home to Bowling Green, where" 
+ "Matthew and Brad Shultz asked him to learn bass and join their band. Seven years later, Tichenor is supplying"    
+ "pocket lines on songs such as “Take It or Leave It” and “Halo” with the poise of a seasoned veteran and the"      
+ "gratitude of a man given a second chance."
