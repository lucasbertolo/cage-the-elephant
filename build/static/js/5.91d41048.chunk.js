The group currently consists of vocalist Matthew Shultz, rhythm guitarist Brad Shultz, drummer Jared Champion and bassist Daniel Tichenor, as well as touring keyboardist/guitarist Matthan Minster and touring lead guitarist Nick Bockrath. Lincoln Parish served as the band's lead guitarist from their formation in 2006 until December 2013, when he left on good terms to pursue a career in producing. The band's first album, Cage the Elephant, was released in 2008 to much success, spawning several successful radio singles and gained the band a large following in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Cage the Elephant are known for their energetic live performances and eclectic sound[according to whom?]. The band's first album is influenced by classic rock, funk, and blues music. However, the band's second album, Thank You, Happy Birthday, displayed heavy influence by punk rock as well as bands such as Pixies and Nirvana, while Melophobia was a concerted effort by the band to find its own distinct musical identity, and earned them a Grammy Award nomination in 2015 for Best Alternative Music Album. Cage the Elephant's fourth album, Tell Me I'm Pretty, produced by Dan Auerbach, was released on December 18, 2015. The album won the award for Best Rock Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. The band's newest release, Unpeeled, is a live album that was released on July 28, 2017."))))))});a.default=i},466:function(e,a,n){var t=n(467);"string"===typeof t&&(t=[[e.i,t,""]]);var r={hmr:!1};r.transform=void 0;n(105)(t,r);t.locals&&(e.exports=t.locals)},467:function(e,a,n){a=e.exports=n(104)(!0),a.push([e.i,"#container-article{background:url(https://al8cddccn.cloudimg.io/cdn/n/webp-lossy-70.jpg-lossy-70/i.imgur.com/et2LWJy.jpg) no-repeat 50%;background-size:cover}#article{height:600px;overflow-y:scroll}@media only screen and (max-width:768px){#article p{font-size:1.3em}}@media only screen and (max-width:600px){#container-article{background:#fff}#article{background:transparent;font-style:bold}#article p{font-size:1.2em}}","",{version:3,sources:["/Users/lucasbertolo/Desktop/projects/cage-the-elephant/src/components/About/About.css"],names:[],mappings:"AAAA,mBACC,qHAAgI,AAChI,qBAAuB,CACvB,AAED,SACC,aAAc,AACd,iBAAmB,CACnB,AAED,yCACE,WAAW,eAAgB,CAAC,CAC7B,AAED,yCACG,mBACC,eAAkB,CAClB,AACD,SACC,uBAAwB,AACxB,eAAiB,CACjB,AAED,WAAa,eAAiB,CAAE,CAClC",file:"About.css",sourcesContent:["#container-article{\n\tbackground: url(https://al8cddccn.cloudimg.io/cdn/n/webp-lossy-70.jpg-lossy-70/i.imgur.com/et2LWJy.jpg) no-repeat center center;\n\tbackground-size: cover;\n}\n\n#article{\n\theight: 600px;\n\toverflow-y: scroll;\n}\n\n@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {\n  #article p{font-size: 1.3em}\n}\n\n@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {\n   #container-article{\n    background: white;\n   }\n   #article{\n    background: transparent;\n    font-style: bold;\n   }\n\n   #article p { font-size: 1.2em; }\n}"],sourceRoot:""}])}});
